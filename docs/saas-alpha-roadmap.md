# 90-Day SaaS Alpha Roadmap

This document describes the strategic path from v1.0 (local governance runtime) to a SaaS Alpha. This is a **design document** — no implementation is included in v1.0.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Cloud OBSERVES, local EXECUTES** — this invariant is permanent.
2. Local runtime remains authoritative for all execution decisions.
3. Policy evaluation remains local.
4. Injection logic remains local.
5. Cloud cannot execute commands.

---

## Phase 1 — Stabilization (Days 0–30)

**Goal:** Validate v1.0 stability under real-world usage before adding any cloud surface.

### Tasks

- Soak testing: run AtlasBridge continuously for 7+ days with mixed workloads
- Performance benchmarks: measure prompt detection latency, injection throughput, SQLite WAL contention under concurrent sessions
- Console usage validation: verify operator console handles daemon + dashboard + agent lifecycle reliably
- Threat model hardening: review local-only attack surface for any gaps missed in v1.0

### Exit Criteria

- Zero invariant violations over 7-day soak period
- P95 prompt detection latency < 500ms
- No deadlocks or resource leaks under 3 concurrent sessions
- Threat model review signed off

---

## Phase 2 — Observe-Only SaaS (Days 30–60)

**Goal:** Build cloud ingestion for observability data. No remote execution.

### Architecture

```
Local Runtime                    Cloud Service
┌──────────────┐                ┌──────────────┐
│ AtlasBridge  │  ── signed ──> │ Ingestion    │
│ v1.x         │     traces     │ API          │
│              │  ── metadata ─>│              │
│ (executes)   │                │ (observes)   │
└──────────────┘                └──────────────┘
                                       │
                                       ▼
                                ┌──────────────┐
                                │ Cloud        │
                                │ Dashboard    │
                                └──────────────┘
```

### Tasks

- Signed trace ingestion: local runtime signs decision trace entries with HMAC before upload
- Metadata-only upload: session metadata, prompt counts, policy match rates — no prompt content by default
- Cloud dashboard: read-only view of ingested traces (replaces local dashboard for multi-machine visibility)
- No remote execution: cloud has no API to trigger actions on local runtime
- No remote policy enforcement: cloud cannot evaluate policies or inject replies

### Required New Contracts

- **Ingestion API schema** — versioned schema for trace upload payloads
- **Signed payload format** — HMAC-SHA256 signature spec for trace authenticity

### Required Security Gates

- Signed payload validation (reject unsigned or tampered traces)
- Rate limiting (per-agent, per-tenant)
- Content redaction options (allow operators to exclude prompt content from uploads)

### Exit Criteria

- Trace ingestion functional with signed payloads
- Cloud dashboard displays session timelines from ingested data
- No local runtime changes required (upload is opt-in via config)
- Penetration test on ingestion API passed

---

## Phase 3 — Multi-Tenant Alpha (Days 60–90)

**Goal:** Add tenant isolation, basic auth, and invite-only access.

### Tasks

- **Tenant IDs** — each organization gets a unique tenant identifier; all cloud data is scoped to tenant
- **Isolation model** — row-level security on PostgreSQL; tenant_id column on all tables; no cross-tenant data access
- **Basic RBAC** — viewer (read traces), operator (manage agents), admin (manage tenant settings)
- **OAuth login** — Google/GitHub OAuth2 for initial access (NOT full SSO/SAML yet)
- **Cloud ingestion auth keys** — per-tenant API keys for trace upload; key rotation support

### Required New Contracts

- **Tenant boundary model** — tenant_id propagation, isolation enforcement, data retention policy
- **Auth token validation** — OAuth2 token verification, API key validation, session management

### Required Security Gates

- Tenant isolation tests — verify no cross-tenant data leakage
- API key rotation without downtime
- OAuth token expiry and refresh handling

### Required CI Expansion

- SaaS service test matrix (PostgreSQL, Redis, OAuth mock)
- Contract compatibility tests (cloud API schema vs. local runtime schema)

### Exit Criteria

- 3+ tenants functional in staging environment
- Zero cross-tenant data leakage in isolation tests
- OAuth login flow complete (Google + GitHub)
- Per-tenant API keys with rotation

## What Must NOT Change

These constraints are permanent across all phases:

| Constraint | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Cloud cannot execute commands | Execution authority stays with the local operator |
| Local runtime remains authoritative | Cloud is advisory; local policy is final |
| Injection logic remains local | No remote code path to PTY stdin |
| Policy evaluation remains local | Cloud may suggest policies; evaluation is always local |
| Dashboard default binding remains loopback | Local dashboard is always localhost-only by default |

---

## 90-Day Milestone Summary

| Day | Milestone | Deliverable |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | v1.0 GA | Local governance runtime released |
| 14 | Freeze window ends | Stability validated, no regressions |
| 30 | Phase 1 complete | Soak test, benchmarks, threat model hardened |
| 45 | Ingestion API alpha | Signed trace upload functional |
| 60 | Phase 2 complete | Cloud dashboard with ingested traces |
| 75 | Multi-tenant alpha | Tenant isolation, OAuth login, API keys |
| 90 | Phase 3 complete | Invite-only SaaS Alpha with 3+ tenants |
