"""
Aegis — Universal Human-in-the-Loop Control Plane for AI Developer Agents.

Aegis sits between you and your AI coding agent. Whenever your agent pauses
and requires human input — approval, confirmation, a choice, or clarification —
Aegis forwards that prompt to your phone. You respond from your phone. Aegis
relays your decision back to the CLI. Execution resumes.
